\"Nuxt-like\" routing in Quasar projects

# Install
```bash
quasar ext add auto-routing
```
Quasar CLI will retrieve it from the NPM registry and install the extension to your project.

Lastly, dive into `src/router/routes.js` and use the generated routes:

```js
import generatedRoutes from './auto-routing' // ðŸ¤¿ Here

const routes = [
  ...generatedRoutes, // ðŸ¤¿ And here
  {
    path: '/',
    component: () => import('layouts/MainLayout.vue'),
    children: [
      { path: '', component: () => import('pages/Index.vue') }
    ]
  },

  // Always leave this as last one,
  // but you can also remove it
  {
    path: '/:catchAll(.*)*',
    component: () => import('pages/Error404.vue')
  }
]

export default routes
```

That's it!
